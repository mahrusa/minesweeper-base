# minesweeper-base
This is a basic Minesweeper app written in Java. The user can customize the dimensions of the mine field and play on it.
A leaderboard of usernames and scores are stored in a txt file, and retrieved each time the program is run. 
Scores and leaderboard ranks are updated after each run.

This is a hobby project I felt like doing in freshman year, but I want to make it bigger and better. My goal is to turn this
skeleton into a full MERN-stack application, where usernames and scores are stored and updated in a database.
